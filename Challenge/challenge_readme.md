# Fares by City Type

## Overview of the Analysis
Offering insights into how different types of cities use Uber allows the organization to make more informed decisions when it comes to strategic planning. This analysis takes Uber ride and driver data from January until April 2019, and provides a comprehensive view of how Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities use Uber.

## Results

### Urban Cities

Urban cities had the higest number total fares and drivers. This follows as Urban cities have much higher population densities than Suburban and Rural. A higher population density means more demand for an Uber ride at any given time of day. The higher number of drivers could also be a contributing factor to Urban cities having the lowest average fare price (both per ride and per driver).

### Suburban Cities

Suburban cities lay between Urban and Rural cities in terms of number of total fares, drivers, and average fare prices. The demand for drivers lessens witin Suburban cities as both population density lessens, and car ownership increases. People in Suburban cities are generally more likely to own a car for commuting to work, or just getting around the city.

### Rural Cities

Rural cities have the lowest amount of drivers and average fare prices. The trends seen in Suburban cities become even stronger in Rural cities. Not only do Rural cities have the lowest population density among the three types of cities presented here, they are also the most geopgraphically spread out. Since one of the determining factors of an Uber fare is how long the ride will be, this will keep prices in Rural cities inherently higher. The combination of a higher average fare, and low population density lead Rural cities to use Uber less.

## Summary

Based on the analysis provided here, there are opportunities for the business to address the gaps seen between the three city types:

* Incentivize use in Rural cities by changing how fare prices are structured to disclude distance (e.g. a flat rate to get anywhere in the city). This can decrease the average fare, and make an Uber ride a more viable option for users.

* Uber can work with Rural city municipalities to present themselves as an alternative to installing a public transportation system. Working with a municipality can allow Uber to lower the prices of operating in a Rural city, and incentivize more users within Rural cities.

* Offer more stable forms of compensation for Uber drivers within Rural cities than a share of the total fare. Rural city drivers aren't guaranteed the quantity of rides drivers in Suburban and Urban cities are. The lack of demand for rides means there is no financial incentive for drivers to "set up shop" in Rural cities.
